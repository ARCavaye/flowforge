A tool for planning MTB Coaching sessions

## Introduction

For a while now I've been looking for a way to store Mountain Bike coaching plans in a way that's shareable and re-usable. Word documents are slow to load and don't play nicely on mobile, its hard to do templates and structure them just as I'd like. I've decided that I could probably do better with a web app - so here we go!
